# BUSINESS ANALYTICS PROJECT

## Overview
* My objective was to evaluate how effectively the company’s website converts product page views into purchases. To achieve this, a conversion funnel was developed to analyze user interactions and identify drop-off points throughout the purchasing process.  The analysis included building acquisition cohorts based on the month of each user’s first purchase. These cohorts were then tracked over time to measure key metrics and identify trends in user retention and purchasing behavior.

### Dataset

1. I received the data on google sheets.


### Method of statements

1.  I created a conversion funnel to better understand how users interact with the website.  
2.  I then created a pivot table to show conversion rates and total conversion rates.  
3.  I then built acquisition cohorts based on the month of a user's first purchase.  
4.  I then I calculated the first purchase date for each user who made a purchase.  These dates will be used toa ssign users to cohorts.
5.  The last steps of the analysis was to aggregate the purchse data into cohorts and then calculate retention rates for each cohort month to month.  

### Technologies
* To build this Project, I used Google Sheets.
