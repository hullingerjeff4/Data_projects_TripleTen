# NYC Airbnb Data

## Overview
* I was hired to analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market to identify the most promising property types for investment. This analysis will leverage Airbnb data to uncover trends and insights that inform strategic investment decisions.  The primary goal is to determine which neighborhoods and property sizes (based on the number of bedrooms) are most attractive to vacation renters. To evaluate each listing’s performance, the analysis will consider both revenue generation and rental activity.  Since Airbnb reviews are only left after a stay, they will serve as a proxy for rental frequency, providing a practical measure of a property’s attractiveness and demand.  This project will ultimately guide the client toward data-driven investment choices in the Manhattan vacation rental market.

### Dataset

1. I was given the data on google sheets.  


### Method of statements

1.  I used pivot tables to find which neighborhoods were the most attractive vacation rentals, the property sizes that are most popular for rentals, and if different neighborhoods have different preferences for property sizes.
2.  I then used a pivot table to find out which 10 neighborhoods were the most attractive for vacation rentals.
3.  I then added a bar chart to display the number of reviews for the top 10 listings in my analysis.
4.  I then built another pivot table to determine the number of bedrooms that are most popular for rentals.
5.  I then updated the pivot table so I could recommend specific property sizes for each of the top 10 neighborhoods.
6.  I then calculated how much money our top listings made.
7.  I used a pivot table that orders all our top listings according to revenue.
8.  In addition, I highlighted how much these recommended listings could earn in a year.
